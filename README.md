If there is anything I can do better, you can alawys say something. I'm active.

You have really done a great work @DeanSoftDev. Welldone!!!
I forked the repository, and added some changes to the code. You may want to merge to your branch. These are the changes below

1. I noticed the images under the RECENT WORK AREA were not displaying. The reason was because you preceded the images' path with a forward slash. previous code :/assets/work/img1.png
current code: assets/work/img1.png *****notice the '/' before the assets in the previous code.
Now the images are displaying.

2. I also created different folders for your js and css files. It is best practice that your javascript and css files should be well organized in separate folders.

Great job :thumbsup: 
Happy Coding!!!
